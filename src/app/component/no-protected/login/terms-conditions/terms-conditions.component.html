            <p>To sign up for a monthly subscription plan, the Licensee must make the payment via Debit Card/ Credit Card, Net Banking, UPI, Wallets or NACH debit mandate. Even if the Licensee intends on paying every month with NACH debit mandate, the Licensor
                requires a first time subscription purchase be made via an online method like Debit Card/ Credit Card, Net Banking, UPI or Wallets.</p>

            <p>Licensor charges and collects in advance for use of the SaaS service. Once a customer selects a subscription plan and provides billing information, Licensor will calculate a pro-rated amount with the first payment due on signing.</p>

            <p>All subscriptions monthly, quarterly and yearly renew automatically on their due renewal date according to date of purchase. Furthermore, Licensor reserves the right to change or modify its fee structure and introduce new charges with at least
                15 days prior notice to the Licensee. Licensees may cancel anytime by emailing a notice to: support@futurewise.co.in. Licensees will receive an email from Licensor confirming that their subscription to the License has been cancelled.</p>

            <p>Important: No refunds or credits for partial months, quarters or years of service will be refunded to a Licensee upon cancellation. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and the Licensee is responsible
                for payments of all such taxes, levies, or duties.</p>

            <p>Licensees have the ability to upgrade or downgrade their subscription plan for the License at any time. For any kind of upgrade or downgrade in subscription, Licensee has to write to support@futurewise.co.in. With regards to downgrades on
                a subscription, Licensor does not issue refunds or credits for partial months of service.
