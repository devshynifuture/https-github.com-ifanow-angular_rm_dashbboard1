    <p class="roboto f-500 pb-8 m-0">What is this option all about?</p>
    <p class="roboto"> With this, you get an option to customize the link with which IFANOW is accessed by you, your
        team and your
        clients. You have an option to either Partially or Completely white label this link.</p>

    <p class="roboto f-500 pb-8 m-0"> What is Partial white label?</p>
    <p class="roboto">Partial white label is where you customize just the subdomain while the main domain remains
        my-planner.in. E.g.
        if your company name is ABC Advisors and you wish to have abcadvisors as the sub domain, then the applicable
        link that you or your clients can access will be https://abcadvisors.my-planner.in.</p>

    <p class="roboto f-500 pb-8 m-0">What is Complete white label?</p>
    <p class="roboto">Complete white label is available if you have a domain of your own. E.g. let's say you own a
        domain called
        abcadvisors.in. Then in this case, you can completely white label the link. So, for instance, you can have a
        completely white labeled link called clients.abcadvisors.in or login.abcadvisors.in</p>

    <p class="roboto f-500 pb-8 m-0">For Complete white label, can I simply link the domain or creating a subdomain is
        necessary?
    </p>
    <p class="roboto">A domain can also be linked. But if you have some content already built on it then it is not
        possible. E.g. lets
        say that your site www.abcadvisors.in is already your website with some content on it. In such a case, you
        cannot link the domain.</p>

    <p class="roboto f-500 pb-8 m-0">What happens if Partial as well as Complete white label option is activated?</p>
    <p class="roboto">In this case, preference is given to Complete white label.</p>
