            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400"> The results of research done by Dalbar Inc., a company which studies
                investor behavior and analyzes investor market returns, consistently show that the average investor
                earns below-average returns.</p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400 pt-12">For the twenty years ending 12/31/2015, the S&P 500 Index averaged
                9.85% a year. A pretty attractive historical return. The average equity fund investor earned a market
                return of only 5.19%.</p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 pt-12 roboto f-700">Why is this?</p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400">Investor behavior is illogical and often based on emotion. This does
                not lead to wise long-term investing decisions. Here's an overview of a few typical money-losing moves
                that average investors make.</p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-700 pt-12">Buying High</p>
            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400">Study after study shows that when the stock market goes up, investors put
                more money in it. And when it goes down, they pull money out. This is akin to running to the mall every
                time the price of something goes up and then returning the merchandise when it is on sale - but you are
                returning it to a store that will only give you the sale price back. This irrational behavior causes
                investor market returns to be substantially less than historical stock market returns</p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-700 pt-12">Overreacting</p>
            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400">The problem is the human reaction, to good news or bad news, is to
                overreact. This emotional reaction causes illogical investment decisions. This tendency to overreact can
                become even greater during times of personal uncertainty; near retirement, for example, or when the
                economy is bad. The study of behavioral finance documents and labels our money-losing mind tricks with
                terms like "recency bias" and "overconfidence." </p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400 pt-12">With overconfidence, you naturally think you are above average. For
                example
                in one study, 81% of new business owners thought that they had a good chance of succeeding, but that
                only 39% of their peers did. In another study, 82% of young U.S. drivers considered themselves in the
                top 30% of their group in terms of safety.</p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400 pt-12">When it comes to investing, overconfidence causes investors to
                exaggerate
                their ability to predict future events. They are quick to use past data, and to think they have above
                average abilities that enable them to predict market movements into the future.</p>

            <p class="m-0 f-16 roboto f-400 pt-12">Popular books, like Carl Richard's The Behavior Gap, also do a great
                job of
                explaining the behavioral decisions that lead to the large gap between market returns and actual
                investor returns. Despite the research and education, the gap continues. So what can you do to avoid the
                fate of the average investor? </p>
